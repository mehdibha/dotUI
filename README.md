## What's different from shadcn-ui

shadcn-ui gives you a starting point to create your component library, but this starting point is the same for everyone.
dotUI gives you a custom starting point based on the theme you've chosen or created.

## Why react-aria?

Because react-aria has a lot more features than radix, primitive components are reusable, has more flexibility, is actively maintained by Adobe, it's just better.
