## How it works?

1. You can start by choosing or creating your style
2. Init the foundations

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init @dotui/{styleName}/base
```

3. Add any component

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @dotui/{styleName}/button
```

## FAQ

### What's different from shadcn-ui

shadcn-ui gives you a starting point to create your component library, but this starting point is the same for everyone.<br/>
dotUI gives you a custom starting point based on the style you've chosen or created.

- We use react-aria-components instead of radix-ui.
- We use tailwind-variants instead of cva.
- The color system is based on 6 color scales (neutral, accent, warning, info, danger and success).
- All components offers the posssibility to use composition or not.
