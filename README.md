# dotUI

dotUI helps you quickly build a component library with a **unique look**.

## How it works?

> A theme defines **colors, fonts, icons, components styles, and more**.  

Every project init requires a theme. You can choose from existing themes or create your own with our builder.

```bash
npx dotui-cli init <theme-name>
```

## FAQ

### What's different from shadcn-ui

shadcn-ui gives you a starting point to create your component library, but this starting point is the same for everyone.<br/>
dotUI gives you a custom starting point based on the theme you've chosen or created.

- We use react-aria instead of radix-ui.
- We use tailwind-variants instead of cva.
- The color system is based on 6 color scales (neutral, accent, warning, info, danger and success).
- All components offers the posssibility to use composition or not.
- For each component, multiple styles are available.
