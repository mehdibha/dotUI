Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and\n            “readable” are often used synonymously, typographically they are\n            separate but related concepts.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be\n            distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy as\n            “the quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For instance,\n            if a “b” and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to\n            distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of legibility.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their\n            job to select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of\n            a font containing many characters that might be difficult to\n            distinguish. The selection of cases influences the legibility of\n            typography because using only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces\n            legibility.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </ScrollArea>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n",
