Although in a non-technical sense\n                “legible” and “readable” are often used synonymously,\n                typographically they are separate but related concepts.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be\n                distinguished from one another. It is described by Walter Tracy\n                as “the quality of being decipherable and recognisable”. For\n                instance, if a “b” and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are\n                difficult to distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of\n                legibility.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is\n                their job to select the correct font to use. Brush Script is an\n                example of a font containing many characters that might be\n                difficult to distinguish. The selection of cases influences the\n                legibility of typography because using only uppercase letters\n                (all-caps) reduces legibility.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </ScrollArea>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n",
