      <p>
        Three fundamental aspects of typography are legibility, readability, and aesthetics.
        Although in a non-technical sense “legible” and “readable” are often used synonymously,
        typographically they are separate but related concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legibility describes how easily individual characters can be distinguished from one
        another. It is described by Walter Tracy as “the quality of being decipherable and
        recognisable”. For instance, if a “b” and an “h”, or a “3” and an “8”, are difficult to
        distinguish at small sizes, this is a problem of legibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typographers are concerned with legibility insofar as it is their job to select the
        correct font to use. Brush Script is an example of a font containing many characters
        that might be difficult to distinguish. The selection of cases influences the legibility
        of typography because using only uppercase letters (all-caps) reduces legibility.

  preview={`<div className="rounded-md border p-6">
  <ScrollArea
    scrollbars={scrollbars as ScrollAreaProps["scrollbars"]}

| Prop              | Type                                        | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `type`            | `'auto' \| 'always' \| 'scroll' \| 'hover'` | `'hover'`    | Describes the nature of scrollbar visibility.                                                                                                                                              |
