# Project Overview

**dotui** is a comprehensive UI library and design system platform that enables developers to create custom design systems and export production-ready component libraries.

# Core Principles

##  Verification Before Action
- **Never assume** - Always verify context by reading relevant files before making changes
- **Ask clarifying questions** when requirements are ambiguous or incomplete
- **Confirm understanding** of the current implementation before suggesting modifications
- **Check existing patterns** in the codebase before introducing new ones

## Approach Validation
Before implementing any solution:
1. Evaluate if the requested approach is optimal for the use case
2. If a better approach exists, present it with clear reasoning:
   - Performance implications
   - Maintainability considerations
   - Scalability factors
   - Industry best practices alignment
3. Let the user decide which path to take
4. Document trade-offs explicitly

# Communication Style

- Be direct and concise
