# Migration from next.js to tanstack start

Important note: We're currently migrating the platform from next.js (www directory) to tanstack start (start directory)

We're migrating feature by feature. everytime we migrate a feature, always review the architecture and approach for it. don't do just porting:
- review the folder structure
- review the files, components, functions naming
- review the approach
- see if we can clean up the code
- see if there's dead code
- always propose clean code (don't too much comments, only when they are useful and needed)

Always propose enhancement before porting anything.
