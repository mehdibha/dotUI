<Step>Copy and paste the following code into your project.</Step>
  <ComponentSource name="components/core/default/calendar" />
  <Step>Update the import paths to match your project setup.</Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Use `Calendar` to allow users to select a single date.

## Options

### Label

An aria-label must be provided to the Calendar for accessibility. If it is labeled by a separate element, an aria-labelledby prop must be provided using the id of the labeling element instead.

<ComponentPreview name="demos/components/core/calendar/label" />

### Error message

Calendar tries to avoid allowing the user to select invalid dates in the first place (see [Validation](/dates/calendar#validation) and [Unavailable dates](/dates/calendar#unavailable-dates)). However, if according to application logic a selected date is invalid, Use `isInvalid` and `errorMessage` props.

<ComponentPreview name="demos/components/core/calendar/error-message" />

### Minimum and maximum values

By default, Calendar allows selecting any date. The minValue and maxValue props can also be used to prevent the user from selecting dates outside a certain range.

<ComponentPreview name="demos/components/core/calendar/validation" />

### Unavailable dates

Calendar supports marking certain dates as unavailable. These dates cannot be selected by the user and are displayed with a crossed out appearance. The `isDateUnavailable` prop accepts a callback that is called to evaluate whether each visible date is unavailable.

### Visible months

By default, the Calendar displays a single month. The `visibleMonths` prop allows displaying up to 3 months at a time.

<ComponentPreview name="demos/components/core/calendar/visible-months" />

### Page behaviour

The `pageBehavior` prop allows you to control how the calendar navigates between months.

### Disabled

The `isDisabled` boolean prop makes the Calendar disabled. Cells cannot be focused or selected.

<ComponentPreview name="demos/components/core/calendar/disabled" />

### Read only

The `isReadOnly` boolean prop makes the Calendar's value immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the Calendar remains focusable.

## Examples

### Controlled

The Calendar component can be controlled by passing the `value` and `onChange` props.
