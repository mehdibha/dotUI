title: Terms of Service

(under construction)

### Summary

By creating an account or using dotUI, you agree to these terms. You keep ownership of your content; we get a limited license to operate the Service. Generated output is yours, subject to any third‑party licenses. The Service is provided as‑is with limited liability. We may change features and these terms over time.

### Acceptance

Using the Service means you accept these Terms. If you use the Service for an organization, you confirm you have authority to bind that organization.

### Accounts & Acceptable Use

- Keep your account information accurate and your credentials secure.
- Do not abuse, disrupt, scrape where disallowed, or attempt to bypass security.
- Do not upload unlawful, infringing, or harmful content.

### Your Content & License to Us

You own your code, components, templates, and other content ("User Content"). You grant dotUI a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, process, and display User Content to operate the Service and as you direct (e.g., when you publish or share).

### Generated Output & IP

Outputs created with the Service (e.g., code, components, design tokens) are assigned to you, subject to any third‑party/open‑source licenses included in the output. You are responsible for reviewing and using outputs legally and appropriately.

### Open Source Packages

Our open‑source code is licensed under its own licenses (e.g., MIT/Apache‑2.0). Those licenses govern the packages; these Terms govern the hosted Service.

### Third‑Party Services

We rely on third‑party providers (hosting, analytics, payments, etc.). Their terms and privacy policies apply to their services.

### Fees (if applicable)

Paid plans, if offered, will be shown at purchase. Charges are handled by our payment processor. Unless required by law, fees are non‑refundable.

### Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability

The Service is provided "as is" without warranties. To the maximum extent permitted by law, dotUI is not liable for indirect or consequential damages, and our total liability is capped at the greater of US $100 or the fees you paid in the prior 12 months.

### Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for violations or risks to the Service or others.

### Changes

We may update the Service and these Terms. Material changes will be announced in‑product or by updating the "Last updated" date. Continued use means acceptance.

### Privacy & Security

Your use is subject to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).
