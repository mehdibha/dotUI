dotUI is a design system platform that helps you generate a component library tailored to your product’s design language.

Traditional UI libraries often force a specific look — customizing them means wrapping components, writing style overrides, or mixing incompatible APIs. Bringing code into your project like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) did helped, but there’s still time lost adapting defaults to fit a product.

dotUI removes that friction, by defining a few high-level choices for your design system, you'll have a ready-to-use component library that looks like your product — not a one-size-fits-all style.
