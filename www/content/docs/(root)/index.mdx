**dotUI** is a design system platform and component registry that lets you generate a UI library that looks like your product, not a preset.

You know how traditional UI libraries force a default aesthetic? Even the "Open Code" approach still requires hours (or weeks) of refactoring tokens, tweaking styles, and rewriting components. dotUI removes that friction.

You build your design system with our editor in a few clicks, then install it via the shadcn CLI or export it to your favorite AI tool such as [v0](https://v0.dev).

## The foundational layer

I evaluated all major options for the foundational layer. Radix is effectively unmaintained, so the choice came down to [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html). While Base UI is very promising, it's still quite new and missing critical features that dotUI relies on.

**React Aria** was the clear winner: battle-tested, comprehensive, and **incredibly flexible**. I've taken its powerful, unstyled primitives and given them a design system that looks like your product.

## API philosophy

### Composition

The API is designed around composition, where each component generally has a 1:1 relationship with a single DOM element. This makes it easy to style every element, and control the layout and DOM order as needed to implement any pattern.

```tsx
<Select defaultValue="light">
  <Button>
    <SelectValue />
    <ArrowDownIcon />
  </Button>
  <Popover>
    <ListBox>
      <Item id="light">Light</Item>
      <Item id="dark">Dark</Item>
      <Item id="system">System</Item>
    </ListBox>
  </Popover>
</Select>
```

### With default children

I've been using shadcn/ui and radix in several projects now, and yes, composition gives you much more flexibility, but it also adds too much boilerplate code.

### Reusable components

Most UI libraries claim to be "composable" but end up creating duplicate components for
every use case. You end up memorizing parallel APIs for the exact same pattern:

You'll find MenuPopover, ComboboxPopover, DialogPopover, SelectPopover, when really they're just a **Popover** component.

You'll also find "MenuTrigger", "ComboboxTrigger", "DialogTrigger", "ModalTrigger", "AlertDialogTrigger", "PopoverTrigger", when a "Button" should work everywhere.

**dotUI gives you true reusable primitives across the entire library.** One `Popover`
component that works with menus, dialogs, selects, and comboboxes. One `Button` component
that works as any trigger. One `Input` component that works in text fields, search fields,
and number fields. One `Label` component that works everywhere you need a label.

This isn't just about a few components—it's a fundamental architectural principle. Every
component is a true primitive that composes naturally with others, eliminating duplication
and giving you real reusability.

## Documentation

### Showing rather than telling

Each component in dotUI comes with an interactive playground where you can play with the props and see the changes in code/preview in real time.

<Demo name="button/demos/default" />

### Real-world examples

Each component page includes multiple real-world examples showing how to use the component in actual application scenarios. From simple use cases to complex compositions, you'll see exactly how components work together.

<div className='grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-6'>

<Example name="button/demos/default" />
<Example name="button/demos/variants" />
<Example name="button/demos/sizes" />
<Example name="button/demos/shapes" />

</div>

## Built for AI

dotUI is built for humans and AI. All components were written with a clear, consistent, and predictable API.
