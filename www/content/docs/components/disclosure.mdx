    ## Installation

    ```npm
    npx shadcn@latest add @dotui/disclosure
    ```

    ## Usage

    A disclosure is a collapsible section of content. It consists of a heading with a trigger button and a panel that contains the content. Users can expand or collapse the content by clicking on the heading.

    ```tsx
    import {
      Disclosure,
      DisclosureHeading,
      DisclosurePanel,
    } from "@/components/ui/disclosure";
    ```

    ```tsx
    <Disclosure>
      <DisclosureHeading>Click to expand</DisclosureHeading>
      <DisclosurePanel>
        Hidden content that is revealed when expanded.
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
    ```
