## Installation

```package-install
npx shadcn@latest add @dotui/form
```

## React Aria

### Label & help text

Accessible forms start with clear, descriptive labels for each field. All dotUI form components support labeling using the Label component or the `label` prop, which is automatically associated with the field via the id and for attributes on your behalf.

In addition, the components support help text, which associates additional context with a field such as a description or error message. The label and help text are announced by assistive technology such as screen readers when the user focuses the field.

```tsx
import { Input, Label, Text, TextField } from "react-aria-components";

<TextField type="password">
  <Label>Password</Label>
  <Input />
  <Text slot="description">Password must be at least 8 characters.</Text>
</TextField>;
```

### Built-in validation

All React Aria form components integrate with native HTML [constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation). This allows you to define constraints on each field such as required, minimum and maximum values, text formats such as email addresses, and even custom regular expression patterns. These constraints are checked by the browser when the user commits changes to the value (e.g. on blur) or submits the form.

<ComponentPreview name="form/demos/react-aria" />

## React Hook Form

In most cases, uncontrolled forms with the builtin validation features are enough. However, if you are building a truly complex form, a separate form library such as React Hook Form may be helpful.

### Anatomy

```tsx
const formSchema = z.object({
  // Define your form schema
});

const Demo = () => {
  const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm();
  const onSubmit = (values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) => {
    /* Handle form submission */
  };

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <FormControl
        control={control}
        name="..."
        render={(props) => {
          // Your form component
        }}
      />
    </Form>
  );
};
```
