description: Learn how to work with our color system.

Most of current libraries just give you a few predefined colors and call it a “color system”, to keep things “safe” and “simple” so developers can slap them into a project and call it a day.

dotUI, however, is built with a different goal in mind: to help you build a design system that doesn't look like everyone else's. We're not interested in a cookie-cutter solution. Instead, we want to empower you to take the same approach a full design team would use—starting from the ground up with solid foundational principles.

## Fundamentals

There's 3 principles about colors in dotUI we're focusing on:

- **Accessibility**: Your colors should be accessible.
- **Purpose**: Your colors should have a purpose.
- **Uniqueness**: Your colors should be unique.

## Color System

### Neutral palette

Neutral colors apply to most backgrounds, text, and shapes. They don't typically have a meaning associated with them, though they can imply things like disabled states.

dotUI uses 10 tints of neutral colors.

### Neutral alpha

Alpha colors have varying levels of transparency or opacity. Transparency helps UI adapt to different background colors and elevations.
