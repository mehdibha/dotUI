dotUI is a collection of components, utilities and tools that will help you build a robust and **unique** design system for your **React** project.

## Motivation: the familar look problem

> When a component library gets popular, suddenly all apps start looking the same.

### The MUI and co era

In the front-end world, first, when we had [MUI](https://mui.com/), which is a great library btw, styles were bundled with the components, which made customization possible but difficult, we ended up with having all the react apps having that "material look".

**So, what's the solution for that, building a design system from scratch?**

### The headless libraries era

Design systems are widely adopted, but building accessible, cross-device components remains challenging. Unlike native platforms, the web requires companies to custom-style components for brand alignment. Limited built-in UI controls force developers to create components from scratch, leading to duplicated work and high costs. HTML elements lack inherent accessibility, needing ARIA roles and custom JavaScript for behavior. Due to resource constraints, many companies deprioritize accessibility, which contributes to the web's reputation as a less robust platform compared to native apps.

Let's be real, if we want to do this in an accessible way, this represents millions of dollars of investment for each company to duplicate work that many other companies are also doing.

the solution to that: headless libraries, components bundled with functionality but no styles. so companies can build their design system without the need to reinvent the wheel each time.

We're getting there, but we're not there yet. headless libraries are the solution for building unique and accessible design systems, but most of companies/developers don't have the ressources/time to build a complete design system from scratch.

### The copy paste era

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) introduced a new way of building component libraries, by giving developers/campanies a good starting point for building their design system, but the problem is that many people ended up just tweaking some colors, leading to that same look-and-feel across the board. (almost all the shadcn apps i am seeing on [X](https://x.com) have that white and black look)

To solve the familiar look problem, shadcn/ui introduced the 

Developers want to ship fast, but this way they're not shipping unique.

## Solution

So what's the solution?

- A headless library giving you the functionnality for your components.
- A **Custom** starting point to build on top of headless libraries.

But how can we make a custom starting point? that's where dotUI comes in.

I took the challenge to build a custom starting point that can be extremely different from one app to another, resulting in a unique look and feel for each app.

Have a look at the [Themes](/themes) page and see how different themes are.
Try building your own design system using our system and see how **unique** it can be, and this can be done in minutes.


## How does it work?

As a designer, if you want to build a design system from scratch, first thing to focus on is the foundations:

- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Layout







{/* **So… it's another component library?**

Yes and no. dotUI is here to tackle an all-too-familiar issue: when a component library gets popular, suddenly all apps start looking the same.

First, we had [MUI](https://mui.com/), a great component library, but soon enough, every app had that "Material look".
Then came **shadcn**, which took things in a new direction by being _headless_, letting developers control the styling. The problem? Many people ended up just tweaking the colors, leading to that same look-and-feel across the board.

dotUI is different. We believe your app should have its own style and personality, right down to the foundational elements.

### Why dotUI?

Let's be real: developers don't always have the time or resources to design from scratch. While shadcn offered a headless setup and a good starting point, creating unique themes still felt challenging, especially for matching colors and consistent styles. Plus, maintaining different component styles? Pretty tough—just look at how limited the options can be.

dotUI was created to bridge this gap. We provide a **complete toolkit** for building your own design system from scratch, giving you full control over:

- **Color Scales**: Easily generate accessible color palettes that don't just look good but _feel_ right in your app.
- **Spacing & Layout**: Define and control your spacing and layout scales for a consistent look.
- **Component Styles**: Choose between different styles for buttons, inputs, focus states, and more, allowing you to create a unique look for each component.
- **Typography & Iconography**: Bring in fonts and icons that align with your brand, ensuring everything fits seamlessly.

### How's dotUI Different?

With dotUI, you're not just changing a color or two; you're building a **complete design system** from the ground up. Whether it's color, spacing, or typography, every detail is customizable. We give you a strong starting point, but you decide the style, layout, and vibe of your app.

### Ready to Build?

If you're looking for a library that gives you freedom without the frustration, dotUI might just be what you need. Start creating your app with a unique, accessible, and modern look—and make it truly yours. */}
