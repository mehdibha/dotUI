dotUI is a collection of components, utilities and tools that will help you build a robust and **unique** design system for your **React** project.

## Motivation: the familar look problem

> When a component library gets popular, suddenly all apps start looking the same.

### The MUI and co era

In the front-end world, first, when we had [MUI](https://mui.com/), which is a great library btw, styles were bundled with the components, which made customization possible but difficult, we ended up with having all the react apps having that "material look".

**So, what's the solution for that, building a design system from scratch?**

### The headless libraries era

Design systems are widely adopted, but building accessible, cross-device components remains challenging. Unlike native platforms, the web requires companies to custom-style components for brand alignment. Limited built-in UI controls force developers to create components from scratch, leading to duplicated work and high costs. HTML elements lack inherent accessibility, needing ARIA roles and custom JavaScript for behavior. Due to resource constraints, many companies deprioritize accessibility, which contributes to the web's reputation as a less robust platform compared to native apps.

Let's be real, if we want to do this in an accessible way, this represents millions of dollars of investment for each company to duplicate work that many other companies are also doing.

the solution to that: headless libraries, components bundled with functionality but no styles. so companies can build their design system without the need to reinvent the wheel each time.

We're getting there, but we're not there yet. headless libraries are the solution for building unique and accessible design systems, but most of companies/developers don't have the ressources/time to build a complete design system from scratch.

### The copy paste era

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) introduced a new way of building component libraries, by giving developers/campanies a good starting point for building their design system, but the problem is that many people ended up just tweaking some colors, leading to that same look-and-feel across the board. (almost all the shadcn apps i am seeing on [X](https://x.com) have that white and black look)

To solve the familiar look problem, shadcn/ui introduced the 

Developers want to ship fast, but this way they're not shipping unique.

## Solution: a custom starting point

So what's the solution?

- A headless library giving you the functionnality for your components.
- A **Custom** starting point to build on top of headless libraries.

But how can we make a custom starting point? that's where dotUI comes in.

I took the challenge to build a custom starting point that can be extremely different from one app to another, resulting in a unique look and feel for each app.

Have a look at the [Themes](/themes) page and see how different themes are.
Try building your own design system using our system and see how **unique** it can be, and this can be done in minutes.
